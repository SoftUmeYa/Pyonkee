# Pyonkee

## Overview

[Pyonkee](http://softumeya.com/pyonkee/en/) is a visual-programming language running on iPad. It is based on Scratch from the MIT Media Laboratory.

Pyonkee has been developed from [the open-source code of "Scratch 1.4"](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_1.4_Source_Code) from MIT. Since Pyonkee is fully compatible with Scratch 1.4, millions of existing Scratch projects can be used for reference. 

Pyonkee's user interface is optimized for touch devices. We do not need cumbersome typing, even a mouse. Just write programs wherever you like. Pyonkee nicely supports pinch-in/out, and font scaling for small devices. Moreover, sound recorder and camera are provided for importing your sounds and pictures into the projects. We can mix various media on Pyonkee and program them.

## History

Pyonkee was originally started as a fork of [John M McIntosh](https://www.smalltalkconsulting.com)'s Scratch Viewer - [Scratch.app.for.iOS](https://github.com/johnmci/Scratch.app.for.iOS). While Scratch Viewer just works as a viewer of the existing Scratch projects, Pyonkee supports creation/edit of projects.

### Other major modifications from the viewer:

- User interfaces are optimized for iPad (Viewer supports both iPhone and iPad)
- Native font support
- Embedded camera support
- IME support
- Auto-saving project
- Sending/Receiving projects via e-mail
- Project import/export through iTunes
- Photo importer/trimmer
- Project sharing via AirDrop
- iPad built-in sensors support
- "Mesh" network protocol support - (project variables/events are sharable with connected peers)
- Built-in MIDI synth
- Virtual MIDI support
- iCloud based project/sprite/costume/sounds sharing
- Touch scrolling support
- Connectivity with micro:bit via Bluetooth LE

## How to build

From version 2.3, [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is partly used for library management.
Before building from Xcode, please install Carthage and run the command below:

```carthage update --use-xcframeworks```

You need to specify `--no-use-binaries` for MIKMIDI.
```carthage update MIKMIDI --use-xcframeworks --no-use-binaries```

### Note on iCloud feature

When attempting to build and run on a physical iPad (not the simulator), you will receive the message:

The 'iCloud' feature is only available to users enrolled in Apple Developer Program. Please visit https://developer.apple.com/programs/ to enroll.

To disable iCloud and allow the build to continue, change line 2257 of Pyonkee.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj from:

```
com.apple.iCloud = {
	enabled = 1;
};
```

to

```
com.apple.iCloud = {
	enabled = 0;
};
```

which will disable iCloud and allow the build to continue.
